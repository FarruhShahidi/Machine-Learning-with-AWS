# Machine-Learning-with-AWS


This repo consists of the following machine learning projects on AWS.\\

1. Tensorflow with Amazon Sagemaker. \\

In this project, which is a guided project from Coursera, I  train and deploy an image classifier created and trained with the TensorFlow framework within the Amazon Sagemaker ecosystem. Sagemaker provides a number of machine learning algorithms ready to be used for solving a number of tasks. However, it is possible to use Sagemaker for custom training scripts as well. We will use TensorFlow and Sagemaker's TensorFlow Estimator to create, train and deploy a model that will be able to classify images of dogs and cats from the popular Oxford IIIT Pet Dataset.
