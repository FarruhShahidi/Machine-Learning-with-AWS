# Machine-Learning-with-AWS


This repo consists of the following machine learning projects on AWS.

# 1. Tensorflow with Amazon Sagemaker. 

In this project, which is a guided project from Coursera, I  train and deploy an image classifier created and trained with the TensorFlow framework within the Amazon Sagemaker ecosystem. Sagemaker provides a number of machine learning algorithms ready to be used for solving a number of tasks. However, it is possible to use Sagemaker for custom training scripts as well. I will use TensorFlow and Sagemaker's TensorFlow Estimator to create, train and deploy a model that will be able to classify images of dogs and cats from the popular Oxford IIIT Pet Dataset.

The classification uses mobilenetV2 architechture developed by Google. For more info about mobilenet click on [this](<https://towardsdatascience.com/review-mobilenetv2-light-weight-model-image-classification-8febb490e61c>). To read the paper click on [this](<https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.04381>).
